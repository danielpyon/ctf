ROP works even with DEP since code execution is not on the stack, but on "gadgets" elsewhere. ROP requires control of the stack, and often involves chaining multiple gadgets together (this is possible if the gadgets end in ```ret```).

## tools

- ```find```: command in GDB to look for strings like ```/bin/sh```
- ```info proc mappings```: view memory segments, useful for finding ```libc``` base address
- ```ropper```, ```ROPgadget```: search for gadgets (sometimes they just tell you the offset)
- ```checksec```: show security mitigations of binary

## simple example
```
# pop rsi ; pop r15 ; ret
ropchain += p64(0x400e91)
ropchain += p64(0x0)
ropchain += p64(0x0)

# pop rdi ; ret
ropchain += p64(0x400e93)
ropchain += p64(0x7f00005b8d57) # /bin/sh

# pop rdx ; ret
ropchain += p64(0x7f000042db92)
ropchain += p64(0x0)

# pop rax ; ret
ropchain += p64(0x7f000045f544)
ropchain += p64(0x3b)

# syscall ; ret
ropchain += p64(0x7f00004e8375)
```
Since ```rsp``` moves up after the ```ret```, you can control what ```rdi``` holds, for instance, by putting it on the stack after the address of the ```pop rdi ; ret``` gadget. This example calls ```execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL)```.

## stack pivot
Sometimes, the executable doesn't give you much control over the stack. For example, you might be able to overwrite ```rbp``` and ```rip```, but not anything past that due to input limitations. In this case, you could move the stack to a region that you control (like the heap, or another buffer).

There are a few gadgets that can accomplish this:

- ```leave ; ret```: this is just ```mov rsp, rbp ; pop rbp```, so you could move ```rsp``` to whatever is in ```rbp```
- ```xchg rsp, rbp ; ret```: this isn't very common, but does the same thing
- ```add/sub rsp _ ; ret```: you could slide the stack pointer down somewhere else
